# Validation

## Validation of Results 

The Hand Tracking Tool provides a handy approach to validate tracking results. Once the distance signals are computed and presented in a plot, you can follow these steps to validate your results: 

  - Press and hold ++v++ in your keyboard
  - Click on the plot, make sure to click directly on the line 
  - The video position will be updated to match the time corresponding to the click on the plot.
